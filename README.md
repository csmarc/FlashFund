## Deploy

### Render

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy)

Deploy on [Render](https://render.com/) free tier. You will need to configure you [Custom Domain](https://render.com/docs/custom-domains) after it deploys.

Services on [free plan](https://render.com/docs/free) are automatically spun down after 15 minutes of inactivity. When a new request for a free service comes in, Render spins it up again so it can process the request. This can cause a response delay of up to 30 seconds for the first request that comes in after a period of inactivity.

**Fatbear Pro Tip:** You could setup a cron job on your umbrel to curl the `/healthz` endpoint every ~15 minutes.

## Umbrel

There are a few additional setups required for this to work on your Umbrel node. That is until [Issue 1082](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel/issues/1082) has been resolved.

STEPS:

1. SSH to your umbrel server `ssh umbrel@umbrel.local` you will need your umbrel password
2. Find your LND REST browser URL `cat umbrel/tor/data/lnd-rest/hostname`. It have a bunch of characters and end with `.onion`. Prepend `https://` and append `:8080` to this values to get `LNADDR_LND_REST_BASE_URL` env variable.
3. Open your LND Config File `vim umbrel/lnd/lnd.conf`
4. Under Application Options add an additional `tlsextradomain` line with your hostname from step 2.
5. Restart your Umbrel. Can be done from your Umbrel's settings UI.

Your lnd.config should have two `tlsextradomain` lines. e.g.

```
tlsextradomain=umbrel.local
tlsextradomain=xxxxxx.onion
```

## Create Invoice Macaroon

You will need a HEX encoded macaroon for the `LNADDR_LND_REST_MACAROON_HEX` env variable.
I highly recommend generating a macaroon with only create invoice permissions. You can use Thunderhub to do this easily.

1. Open Thunderhub
2. Go to `Tools` in sidebar
3. Bakery -> Bake Macaroon
4. Give `Create Invoice` permissions
5. Hit `Bake new macaroon` button.
6. Copy the HEX encoded value
